For example, if your vector contains such line - '05 goto step    21            if calls-queued     in skill 1     pri h  >  18', what means - if queued calls more than 18 go to step 21 which is announcement about all agents busy, and please call later. We can dynamically change queue size according staffed agents in system, which will help reduce the number of customers in a queue, therefore will enable you to save your money. First of all, wright down your site credentials (telnetconnector.py), get coordinate of parameter in vector (getcoordinate.py), in my case 'f8088ff05', find out how many agents logged in (staffedagents.py), put that value in your vector do that trick (paramset.py)
